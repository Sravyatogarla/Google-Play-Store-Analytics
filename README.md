# Google Play Store Analytics

This project is a deep-dive analysis of Google Play Store apps. Using data wrangling, cleaning, and visualization, we explore app popularity, category distribution, ratings, installs, update patterns, sentiment trends, and revenue opportunities.  
This project was developed as part of the *NullClass* Data Science training program.

- Analyze the relationship between app installs, ratings, and reviews.
- Understand the most popular categories and genres.
- Compare free vs paid apps revenue generation.
- Track app update frequency and its impact.
- Study the overall sentiment from user reviews.
- Derive insights into app size, pricing, and content rating trends.
