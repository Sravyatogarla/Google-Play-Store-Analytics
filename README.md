# Google Play Store Analytics

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of apps on the Google Play Store using Python and interactive visualizations.This project is a deep-dive analysis of Google Play Store apps. Using data wrangling, cleaning, and visualization, we explore app popularity, category distribution, ratings, installs, update patterns, sentiment trends, and revenue opportunities.  
This project was developed as part of the *NullClass* Data Science training program.

- This project also includes an **Internship Task Module** with individual assignments broken down into dedicated folders for structured execution and submission.

## Project Objectives:

- Analyze the relationship between app installs, ratings, and reviews.
- Understand the most popular categories and genres.
- Compare free vs paid apps revenue generation.
- Track app update frequency and its impact.
- Study the overall sentiment from user reviews.
- Derive insights into app size, pricing, and content rating trends.

## Dataset:

- *Play Store Data.csv*:  
  Contains app details like name, category, rating, size, installs, type (Free/Paid), price, content rating, genres, last updated date, and Android version requirements.
- *User Reviews.csv*

README.md describing the task

📈 Main Analysis Summary
The main analysis notebook (Play Store Data Analysis.ipynb) explores:

Top categories by number of apps

Category-wise installs and reviews

Rating trends

Revenue potential by app type

Comparison of free vs paid apps

Popular app genres

## Key Insights:

- *Category Dominance:* Some categories like Art & Design, Games, and Education dominate installs.
- *App Size vs Installs:* Smaller apps tend to have higher install numbers.
- *Paid Apps Revenue:* Although fewer, paid apps can generate significant revenue if targeted correctly.
- *Update Frequency:* Regular updates positively correlate with better app ratings.
- *Sentiment Trend:* Apps with timely support and bug fixes have better sentiment reviews.

## Future Improvements:

- Building a recommendation model for developers to optimize app ratings and installs.
- Creating a dashboard for real-time tracking of app performance.
- Using NLP to deeply analyze user review sentiments.

> Project Conclusion:
 
Through the analysis of Google play store data, we gained valuable insights into preferences, app performance, and market trends. It was observed that the majority of apps are free, with a higher concentration in categories like Family and Games.

User Sentiment analysis revealed that most feedback is positive, but apps, although they are fewer in number. Overall, this project highlights the importance of regular updates, user engagement, and strategic app pricing to succeed in the competitive play store environment
